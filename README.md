# SoccerNet - Action Spotting

Welcome to the SoccerNet Development Kit for the Action Spotting Task and Challenge. This kit is meant as a help to get started working with the soccernet data and the proposed task. More information about the dataset can be found on our [official website](https://soccer-net.org/).

SoccerNet Action Spotting is part of the SoccerNet-v2 dataset, which is an extension of SoccerNet-v1 with new and challenging tasks including
action spotting, camera shot segmentation with boundary detection, and a novel replay grounding task.

The Action Spotting dataset consists of 500 complete soccer games including:
 - Full untrimmed broadcast videos in both low and high resolution.
 - Pre-computed features such as ResNET-152.
 - Annotations of actions among 17 classes (Labels-v2.json).

Participate in our upcoming Challenge in the [CVPR 2022 International Challenge on Activity Recognition Workshop](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2021/index.html) and try to win up to 1000$ sponsored by [SportRadar](https://www.sportradar.com/)! All details can be found on the [challenge website](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/761/overview), or on the [main page](https://soccer-net.org/).

The participation deadline is fixed at the 30th of May 2022.
The official rules and guidelines are available on [ChallengeRules.md](ChallengeRules.md).

## How to download SoccerNet-v2 

A [SoccerNet pip package](https://pypi.org/project/SoccerNet/) to easily download the data and the annotations is available. 

To install the pip package simply run:

<code>pip install SoccerNet</code>

Please follow the instructions provided in the [Download](Download) folder of this repository. Do also mind that signing an Non-Disclosure agreement (NDA) is required to access the LQ and HQ videos: [NDA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYFqjZNm4IgwGnyJXDPk2Ko_lZcbVtYX73w5lf6din5nxfmA/viewform).

## How to extract video features 

As it was one of the most requested features on SoccerNet-V1, this repository provides functions to automatically extract the ResNet-152 features and compute the PCA on your own broadcast videos. These functions allow you to test pre-trained action spotting, camera segmentation or replay grounding models on your own games.

The functions to extract the video features can be found in the [Features](Features) folder.

## Benchmark Implementations

This repository contains several baselines for each task which are presented in the [SoccerNet-V2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13367.pdf), or subsequent papers. You can use these codes to build upon our methods and improve the performances.

## Evaluation

This repository and the pip package provide evaluation functions for the proposed tasks based on predictions saved in the JSON format. See the [Evaluation](Evaluation) folder of this repository for more details.

## Visualizations

Finally, this repository provides the [Annotation tool](Annotation) used to annotate the actions. This tool can be used to visualize the information. Please follow the instruction in the dedicated folder for more details.
